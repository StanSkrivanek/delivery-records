# TODO List for Delivery Records App

This document outlines the tasks and features to be implemented in the Delivery Records application. The goal is to enhance functionality, improve user experience, and ensure maintainability of the codebase.

## Homepage

Homepage Ideas for Delivery Records App
For your delivery records app homepage, I'd recommend a dashboard-style layout that gives users an immediate overview of key information and quick access to common actions. Here's what you could include:

### Key Components for Your Homepage

**1. Summary Statistics Card**

- Total deliveries this month
- Total collections this month
- Current month's revenue
- Month-over-month comparison indicators

**2. Quick Actions**

- "Add New Record" button (prominent)
- "View Analytics" button
- "Export Data" button

**3. Recent Records**

- A compact table showing the 5-10 most recent delivery records
- Each row should have quick "Edit" and "View" buttons
- "View All Records" link at the bottom

**4. Visualization**

- A simple chart showing delivery trends over the past week or month
- Perhaps a bar chart comparing current month vs previous month

**5. Calendar View** 
  - A mini-calendar highlighting days with deliveries 
  - Clicking on a day could filter to show just those records

**6. Notifications or Alerts**
   - Any missing information from recent records
   - Unusual patterns (significantly higher/lower deliveries)
   - Reminders about reporting deadlines
